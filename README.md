Howdy! This project was created for as a means of giving back to a small youtube channel that has been providing me with entertainment for years. Previously, they had a very dated and broken website and I knew that I could do better. The site features a custom logo, custom badges with common catchphrases, is responsive, has a section of "Featured" videos that will always pull up the most recent video, and, lastly, has an auto-refreshing SSL certificate through Let's Encrypt.

For no reason other than for my own personal enjoyment, this site's core technologies include ReactJS, Webpack, and Node.

Please provide any code or design feedback you have!

Thanks.
